# ALDE
ALDE, or "Android on Linux Desktop Environments", is an Android SDK layer for Linux
desktop environments. It has the capability of running Android apps/games natively
on Linux, which translates the native Bionic layer into glibc, including running
custom Android systems natively on a Linux system.
