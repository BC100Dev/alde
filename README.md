# ALDE
ALDE, or "Android on Linux Desktop Environments", is an Android SDK layer for Linux
desktop environments. It has the capability of running Android apps/games natively
on Linux, which translates the native Bionic layer into glibc.

Now, it wouldn't be an Android port, when there is no possibility of running an
actual Android system. I will make that possibility that includes using the default
System image, which will do its jobs. No emulators / VMs involved, but within a
Window that will run a full Android system.
